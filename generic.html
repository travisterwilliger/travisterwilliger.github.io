									<h1>Full Stack Development</h1>
								</header>
								<p>A Full Stack Software Developer is someone who has mastered the inner workings of a program, as well as the outer layers that a client or user would deal with. A full stack developer is capable of performing tasks at any level of the technical stack in which they reside. It means, working with systems infrastructure (knowing what hardware to ask for , what OS to install, how to prepare the system and dependencies for all software). It means, understanding, creating, manipulating, and querying databases. Project management / client work, e.g. gathering requirements, creating technical specifications and architecture documents, creating good documentation, managing a project timeline, etc. In general a full-stack developer has knowledge that is a mile wide, but not necessarily very deep, and has core competencies in the pieces of the stack in which they work most.</p>
								<h2>Why do we need Developers?</h2>
								<p>Without even narrowing this down to only Full Stack Developers; Any developer of software, web pages, simple programs, etc. The world is at an ever expanding step in the technology field. We will always need these individuals that do have this knowledge of computers, infrastructures, and how software is developed. Whether you run a business that needs an online presence or you're a photographer that needs to display your work to the world; we will always need developers to move that old school footprint into the digital world where everything else is thriving.</p>
